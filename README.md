# Under Pressure - G6560X IM-QTOF Drift Gas Pressure Tool

Under Pressure is a lightweight application to facilitate monitoring of the drift gas pressures related to the Agilent G6560X IM-QTOF.

## Background

The current method of monitoring drift gas pressures is a little hit and miss. A hyperterminal connection is made and the stream of data in the hyperterminal window is eyeballed.

More exact measurements can be performed by taking the data offline and exporting to CSV followed by manually parsing the data and creating the statistics or graphs as required.

This is labour intensive and does not allow for an online live view resulting in an iterative process of adjusting and checking.
